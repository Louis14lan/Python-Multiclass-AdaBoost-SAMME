## Introduction

SAMME [1] is a multi-class adaboost algorithm. 

## To use:

```
# set up parameters, e.g 500 weak learners and 5 classes
num_learner = 500
num_cats = 5

# prepare your data need to be in the following format
# if data is image and it will be too larger to put them into list
# you can modify the method so that it takes img file id and make it read the image file online
train_data = [(X, label), (X, label), (X, label), ...] 

# put your weak learner into a list
# your weak learner need to have a `.predict(X) -> label` method
# if not, you need to modify the code to make it compatible
weak_learners = [wl1, wl2, ...]  

# construct the booster instance
booster = SAMME(num_learner, num_cats)

# train the booster
booster.train(train_data, weak_learners)

# make prediction
prediction = booster.predict(X)
```

## Dev Log

11/02/19: Implement the main methods. Still need to test.

11/03/19: Added a small number to prevent possible divide by zero case

11/05/19: Tested.
